# JS-Virtual-Piano
a virtual piano I coded with a bit of JavaScript. u can sorta play a song with it but it wont do much

there's a lot of audio files for this one

there are about 40 piano keys

basically it's until the middle C so half the piano

u can try play songs but can't long press so it's quite hard

you can request a pull frome if you have the code for a complete piano
